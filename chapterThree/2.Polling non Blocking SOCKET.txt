it is posible to configure sockets to use non blockig operation.
once in non blocking mode , a call to recv() with no data will return immediately.
a program with this structure in mind could simly check each of its active sockets in turn continusly.
it would handle every socket that returned data and ignore any socket that didnt.
this is called POLLING 
we are not gonna use POLLING :))
