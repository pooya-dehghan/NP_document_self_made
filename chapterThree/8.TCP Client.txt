our program first uses getaddrinfo() to resolve the server address from command line.
then the socket is created with call to socket.
the fresh socket has connect() called on it to connect to the server.
we use select() to monitor for socket input . {select() also monitor for terminal keyboard input on non_windows system}
[on windows we use the _kbhit() function to detect terminal input].
if terminal input is available we send it over socket using send() .
if select() indicate that socket data is available , we read it with recv() and display it to the terminal.
this seleect() loop is repeated until socket is closed.

code will be there soon :)) good luck.
