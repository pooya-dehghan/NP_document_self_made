we can iterate through an fd_set using simple for loop.Essentially , we start at 1,since all socket descriptors are positive numbers .
and we continue through to the largest known socket descriptor in set.
for each possible socket descriptor, we simply use FD_ISET to check if it is in the set.

//code ...

SOCKET i;
for(i = 1; i<=max_socket; i++){
  if(FD_ISET(i,&master)){
    //do something
  }
}
