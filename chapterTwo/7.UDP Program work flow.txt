A UDP client must know the address of the remote UDP peer in order to send the first packet.
the udp client uses getaddrinfo() to resolve the address into a struct addrinfo structure.once this is done client creates a socket of the proper type
the client can then call sendto() on the socket to send first packet [client can continue to call sendto() and recvfrom() to send and receive packets]
(udp client must first send first packet and cannot receive data first)[because other peer wouldnt know where to send data before that]

A UDP server listens for connections from a UDP client. This server should initialize struct addrinfo structure with the proper listening IP address and port number
The getaddrinfo() function can be used to do this in a protocol-independent way.
The server then creates a new socket with socket() and binds it to the listening IP address and port number using bind(). 
At this point, the server can call recvfrom(), which causes it to block until it receives data from a UDP client. After the first data is received, the server can reply with sendto() or listen for more data (from the first client or any new client) with recvfrom().
