All sockets on Unix systems are also standard file descriptors. For this reason, sockets on Unix systems can be closed using the standard close() function.
 On Windows, a special close function is used insteadâ€”closesocket(). It's useful to abstract out this difference with a macro:#if defined(_WIN32)
#define CLOSESOCKET(s) closesocket(s)
#else
#define CLOSESOCKET(s) close(s)
#endif
