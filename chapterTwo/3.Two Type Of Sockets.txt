Sockets come into two basic types [connection_oriented , connectionless](these terms refer to types of protocols).

the two protocols that are used today are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
tcp is connection oriented and udp is connectionless.

in a connectionless protocol such as udp each data packet addressed individually , each data packet is completly independant from 
other dps that come before or after it.

!UDP dosent garantee that any packet will arrive or not , it doenst provide any method that you get to know if packet has reached destination or not
even there is possibility that one dp will reach twice!! :()

on the other hand tcp garantee that packet will arrive and will recieve in order that is sent.
for this reason tcp is used by many protocol such as HTTP and FTP SSH and SMPT

UDP is used by DNS ,(it is suitable for this because an entire req and res can fit in single packet)

udp is commonly used in real time app like video streaming and multiplayer video games.
