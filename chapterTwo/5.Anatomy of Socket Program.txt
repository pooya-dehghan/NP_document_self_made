network programming is usualy uses the client server model which in this model server listens for new connections with a published address
the client knowing the servers address is the one first establishes the connections initialy , once connection is established 
both client and server can send and receive data , this continues till client or server terminates the connection

an alternative paradigm is peertopeer model which both sides are client and server simultaniously

Network programs can usually be described as one of four typesâ€”a TCP server, a TCP client, a UDP server, or a UDP client. Some protocols call for a program to implement two, or even all four types,
but it is useful for us to consider each of the four types separately.
