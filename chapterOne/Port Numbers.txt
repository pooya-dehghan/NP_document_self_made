An IP address alone isn't quite enough. We need port numbers. To return to the telephone analogy, if IP addresses are phone numbers, then port numbers are like phone extensions.

Generally, an IP address gets a packet routed to a specific system, but a port number is used to route the packet to a specific application on that system.

For example, on your system, you may be running multiple web browsers, an email client, and a video-conferencing client. When your computer receives a TCP segment or UDP datagram, your operating system looks at the destination port number in that packet.
That port number is used to look up which application should handle it.

guys dont use reserevd ports !!!
