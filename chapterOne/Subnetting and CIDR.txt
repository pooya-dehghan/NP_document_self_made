ip addresses can split into parts.
the most significant bits are used to identify the network or subnetwork and the least significant bits can be used to identify the 
specific device on the network.
IPv4 traditionally uses a mask notaion to identify the IP address parts. for example consider a router on the 10.0.0.0 network with 
a subnetmask of 255.255.255.0 this router can take any incoming packet and perform a bitwise AND operation with the subnet mask
to determine whether the packet belongs on local subnet or needs to be forwarded on.
which produce 10.0.0.0 
                                              EXAMPLE
this router recievs a packet to be delivered to 10.0.0.105 it does a bitwise AND operation on this address with the subnet mask of 
255.255.255.0 which produce 10.0.0.0 that matches subnet of the router , so the traffic is local .
if instead we consider a packet destinaid for 10.0.15.22 the result of the bitwise is 10.0.15.0 this address doesnt match the subnet router is on
and so it must be forwarded.
