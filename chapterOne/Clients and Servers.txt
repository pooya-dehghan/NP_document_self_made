in client server model 
one party sends requests and another party recieve and answer that req(it listens for connections)
the client knowing address and port number that server is listening on establishes a connection by sending first packet

For example, the web server at example.com listens on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS). A web browser (client) must establish the connection by sending the first packet to the web server address and port.
