if we want our computers to communicate we need some rules and some agreed upon protocols

so if we want some protocols to break down the complexity of networking we need some layers 
the most used method is OSI open systems interconnection which is called OSI model

this model has layers like this ...

7_ Application
6_Presentaion
5_Session
4_Transport
3_Network
2_Data link
1_Physical


Physical : this the level of physical communication in the real world , at this level we have specefications for things such as the voltage on the
ethernet cable , what each pin on a connector is for,the radio frequency fo wifi and ...

Data Link : this level builds on physical layer , it deals with protocols for directly communicatin between two nodes;
it defines how a direct message between nodes starts and ends , error detection and correction and flow control.

Network : the network layer provides the methods to transmit data sequence (packets) between nodes in diffrent networks;
it provides methods to rout packets from one node to another (with out any physical connection) by transfering through many intermediate nodes
this the layer that the internet protocol defiend on 

Transport layer : at this layer we have methods to reliably deliver variable length data between hosts , these methods deal with splitting up data ,
recommbining it ensure data arrive in order ; TCP and UDP are so common

Session layer :  this layer builds on transport layer by adding method to establish, checkpoint ,suspend ,resume and terminate dialogs

Presentaion : this is the lowest layer at which data structure and presentaion for application are defined , concerns such as data encoding 
serialization and encryption are handled here.

Application : the applications which user interfaces with ( such as web browsers and email clients )exist here , this layer 
uses the services which are handled by past six layer.

a quick note here we call any data unit on layers packet ( which is not correct by the way because we call em on layer 2 Fram
on layer 3 we call em packet on layer 4 we call em segment )
